          <p>
            You can only work as a team if all members know what they are
            working towards. These brand meetings helped all of us feel the
            mission personally and are going to pay out in the years ahead as we
            create our strategic goals

          We invested a lot of time as a full team contributing to discussions
          and goal setting around our mission.Days can seem to fly by and
          sometimes meetings on topics not directly related to immediate
          outcomes can seem frivolous, but these discussions brought us all
          closer and helped us focus on what was most important.
